# ChatGPT-Clone-Laravel
ChatGPT-Clone-Laravel is a chatbot application built using Laravel framework and GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) machine learning technology provided by OpenAI. This application can automatically converse with users using text based on responses generated by the GPT chatbot model.

The application features include creating conversations with the chatbot, sending messages to and receiving responses from the chatbot, and displaying a conversation history with the chatbot. The application also has a simple front-end that allows users to easily interact with the chatbot.

Technically, the application utilizes GPT technology that has been pre-trained by OpenAI using a large text corpus, and then integrated with Laravel using the OpenAI API. The application also uses WebSockets to send and receive messages in real-time without needing to reload the page.
